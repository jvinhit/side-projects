Dash Project
=============================
This project is an app using coffeescript, less, d3, backbone, handlebars, and bootstrap that can create a dashboard to display running apps on particular server clusters.

#### Installation and running
1) From the root directory, run `npm install`
2) run `grunt`
3) run `grunt server`
4) navigate to localhost:8888

I wrote this app in backbone because it was the most lightweight library for
a light weight demo app.

I used these bootstrap for quick styling from the get go, attempted to use
fontawesome but the icons were not rendering correctly for some reason. I have
heavy use of lodash for out of the box functionality like finding indexes for
objects in an array.

Used handlebars to pass variables into templates.
