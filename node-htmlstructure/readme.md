### Simple HTML forms and bootstrap tabs

####  To run
You must have node installed. You can install via homebrew on OSX by
simply typing `brew install node`

Once node is installed, you can run `server.js` from the root directory using
`node server.js`

The server is defaulted to run on `localhost:8888`. The two directories you can
access are `localhost:8888/tabber` and `localhost:8888/form`
